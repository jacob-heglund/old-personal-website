My name is Jacob Heglund, and I'm a Masters student in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  This website is mostly a place to organize my professional work, but also a place to promote any side projects I work on.

# I like Robots

They're pretty cool because robotics is one of the only fields where hardware, software, pure math, heuristics, engineering techniques that have been used since the early 20th century, and cutting edge research can all come together to make a cohesive field of study.  

# I like AI

My interest in applications of AI, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and statistics was piqued after taking a course with [Professor Girish Chowdhary](https://abe.illinois.edu/directory/girishc).  In a recent talk (at least recent when I wrote this...), well-known researcher in ML and AI Andrew Ng made the argument that machine learning is the next electricity, in the sense that in 20 years, businesses will change how they operate to utilize machine learning in the same way that businesses 100 years ago changed how they operate to utilize electricity.  I think his position is well-argued, and the effects AI and ML will have on how the world operates cannot be ignored.

# I Really Like Music

I play guitar :guitar:, bass, percussion (including drumset, vibrophone, and triangle *ding*), piano, sing, and produce music.
