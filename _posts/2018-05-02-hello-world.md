A "Hello World!" program is often the first program a person will write when working with a new programming language. This actually a good learning tool since this exercise gives a basic understanding of the program's running environment, as well as understanding of how a language handles strings and command window outputs.  Printing to console is a super useful debugging tool that I use all the time, so one of the first things I would want to do is learn how to do exactly this in a language.  

Here we have a basic Python program that will print out "Hello World!" to the console.

{% highlight ruby %}
myString = "Hello World!"
print(myString)
{% endhighlight %}

A "Hello World!" program can also be as simple as a line or two, but more creative programmers can figure out crazy ways to accomplish the simple goal of printing the 'string' "Hello World!" to the console.  For example, we could use a neural network that takes in a training set containing the string "Hello World!", and train it to produce this string.  There's no limit to the creative ways one can generate this string!
