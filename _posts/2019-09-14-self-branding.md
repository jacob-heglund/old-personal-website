# TE 566 - Self Branding Assignment

## About Me

I am a Master’s student in the Aerospace Engineering department of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  I am studying methods for improving the resilience of transportation systems to disasters and delays.  As part of my work, I have become familiar with cutting edge algorithms (neural networks) for prediction on transportation data sets and have implemented state-of-the-art prediction algorithms in my time as a master’s student.

I am broadly interested in the fields of robotics and learning algorithms, and am especially interested in recent applications of learning algorithms in autonomous vehicles.
